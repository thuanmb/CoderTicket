# Specs in this file have access to a helper object that includes
# the EventsHelper. For example:
#
# describe EventsHelper do
#   describe "string concat" do
#     it "concats two strings with spaces" do
#       expect(helper.concat_strings("this","that")).to eq("this that")
#     end
#   end
# end
# RSpec.describe EventsHelper, type: :helper do
#   include_context "shared context for up coming events"

#   it "loaded list of upcoming events successfully" do
#     events = upcoming_events
#     expect(events).to contain_exactly(@upcomingEvent)
#   end
# end
